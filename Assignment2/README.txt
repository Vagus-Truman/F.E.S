b. Project Description:
   Our project is a Java-based card combat system implemented using a simple card game. 
   It allows two players to engage in turn-based combat using cards with various effects. 
   Each player has a set of cards with different abilities, and they take turns playing these cards to damage or heal their opponent, apply status effects, or buff themselves. 
   The game is played until one player's health reaches zero. 
   The project includes classes for Player 1 and Player 2, as well as a main class to run the game.

   To use the project, simply run the PlayMeDotExe. Taking turns to select cards and apply their effects. 
   The game will continue until one player's health is depleted.

 c. Resources/Inspiration:
   -Java documentation and tutorials for learning Java programming concepts.
   - Existing Tartot Card Reading providing the damage/ healing stats and the descriptions.
